          <h1>MIDSUMMER FUNDRAISING RALLYE</h1>
          <h4>I hope you are doing well and stay healthy trough this rather rough time. I am reaching out to my community for our <b>Midsummer Fundraising Rallye</b> today. We give away unique travel perks to raise funds to cover essential costs of living (e.g. accommodation, education &amp; medical coverage) for my single parent family of four.</h4>

          <h1>Why? How did this happen?</h1>
        </div>

      <div class="sr-container">
          <section class="container">
            <h4>After leaving my previous employment as a senior executive end of 2018 I started a sabbatical to settle my divorce and taking sole custody of my three kids. Our transition took longer than expected as two of my kids have been invited to change school on short notice. While income in 2019 decreased by 90% we relocated to reduce our cost of living by 75%.
            <BR>
            In March Covid-19 pandemic started spreading in Spain. Being vulnerable from the start since having used up most of our savings, I was still eager to search for new job opportunities. I continued having interviews and presenting offers for freelance project work. New job opportunities and projects have been canceled or postponed due to the lock down which lasted the past months.</h4>

           <h4>However, I applied for minimum wage jobs as well but had to learn that I am too old or too experienced for such vacancy. Times are rough, but we are not giving up hope just yet. We are very confident of finding new assignments before end of this year. <b>In this matter, your cordial support matters and makes the difference today</b>.
           <BR>
           In exchange we give away hotel nights, not only intercontinental but also round the world air tickets. We are grateful for any funds which are raised. You are warmly invited to choose your own personal perk or donate directly. <b>Please kindly support our passage to the new normal and spread out this rallye to your community</b>. Sharing is caring. Your action matters. Many thanks and stay healthy.</h4>
